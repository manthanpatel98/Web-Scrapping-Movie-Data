## **Motivation:**
##### This Entire Project is made with a purpose of learning Data Extraction.

## **Web Crawler:**

* Here, I have used **bs4** (BeautifulSoup) library for **Extracting Movie/TV Show Data**.
* **MongoDB** is used to store the data in database.
* Information like **'Title'**,**'Time Period'**,**'Rating'**,**'Genre'**,**'Duration'**,**'Votes'**,**'Directors'**,**'Stars'** and **'Description'** are extracted.
* These information are collected for **60,000+ Movies/TV Shows**.
* For more understanding of the project, refer [IMDB-Movies(60000)-Web-Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Web-Scrapping-Movie-Data/blob/master/IMDB-Movies(60000)-Web-Scrapping.ipynb)
